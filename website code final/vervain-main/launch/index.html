              The MindfullReaders is a non-profit organization for anyone who
              wants to improve their public speaking, communication skills, and
              become more fluent in English. Our goal is to provide a safe,
              supportive, and judgment-free space where people can practice
              speaking, share ideas, and learn how to express themselves with
              confidence. If you're someone who wants to speak more clearly,
              connect with others better, and look at the world with new
              perspectives—we're here for you. The book discussions we are
              having aren’t just presentations—they’re open conversations.
              Anyone can respond, share a different opinion, or add to the
              discussion. This is not just an open mic, it's a discussion
              room—where we practice public speaking, learn how to communicate
              respectfully, and grow together.

          <p class="introduction-text">
            So, when I was kid who used to stammers for most of his life
            earlier. Everyone used to make used to make fun of me for the way I
            speak and that made me not to talk to anyone but one day I decided
            okay I will stop this, whatever is the bug in me I’ll fix it. Then I
            taken professionals advice on this matter, countless yt videos and
            google research on this practices all alone with myself and the
            mirror, years of practice and when I actually became able to control
            it a bit then I understood the problem which was all I need is speak
            and talk with people. Stammering is not actually a biological
            problem it’s just a condition when a person is nervous and anxious
            he develops a habit of taking pause while speaking and that can only
            be solved by talking to people confidently but there was no place
            where I can practiced it because whenever I speak everyone just
            laugh at me. My friends, and even sometimes my family which made me
            realize that are out there so many people like who are suffering
            with same, which has given me the idea of doing something for them,
            people who are suffering with the problem just like me but are not
            able to talk about it because this is something that mainly no one
            cares about that much. But it a matter of consideration because only
            a person who stammers know how it feel. So that’s why I create this
            club. A safe & supportive place with no judgment of anything with no
            age restrictions or anything. you want to talk and speak to people
            about your thoughts, ideas or beliefs and wants to share your
            perspective of seeing the world without the fear of being a joke in
            front of everyone. we are here for you!
